The Story of a Man falling of a bicycle.

I'm Henry, a little man on bike. Henry was a young man who loved to ride his bicycle. He had been riding for hours and was feeling quite exhausted. But he didn't want to give up and kept pedaling. Suddenly he hit a rock, and he lost control of his bicycle. He was thrown off the bike and landed in a ditch.

He was in a lot of pain and his bicycle was completely damaged. He had to walk back home that day, with a deep cut on his knee.

Henry was not deterred by this incident, though. He got a new bicycle, and he went back to riding with more caution. He was more careful, and he made sure to always check the road before he started pedaling.

Although Henry had fallen off his bicycle, he wasn't going to let it stop him from riding. He still looked forward to long rides in the countryside and trips to the nearby town. He kept riding and enjoying the scenery, and soon he was back to his old self.

Henry had learned an important lesson from his accident -

He began to always wear a helmet, no matter how short the ride. He also started to pay more attention to his surroundings when riding, making.
